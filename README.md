# Fully Automated Luxury Commentary

## Setup

You will need to download the audio samples for `main.py` to run. You can do this
by downloading the files from google drive [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xyYFr7cWydqlTmpgbuI93J5YG_f-22bC) (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xyYFr7cWydqlTmpgbuI93J5YG_f-22bC)
and unzipping into the `audio/` directory. (The file is too large to download with `wget` or `curl`;
Google's Virus Scan warning gets in the way.)

Requirements:
  * Python 3.7+
  * ffmpeg
